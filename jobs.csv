What we’re looking for  Someone with broad capability across Dynamics 365 (CRM) and Powerapps - and solid experience developing and architecting solutions.    We are a NZ owned tech consultancy and we operate at several different levels within our client organisations. Most of our clients are large enterprises and we develop a variety of bespoke applications for them.   You will have the opportunity to work on a massive variety of work - the types of applications will build vary and the clients we work alongside also vary, so if you're someone who craves new challenges and loads of variety in their work, then we could likely be the place for you!  In a nutshell…  You will work alongside our Lead Architect and development team and, depending on your exact skills, you may be leading projects from a technical perspective, or playing a key role as a Senior Developer.   You’ll have a proven track record of successfully delivering complex, full life-cycle implementations of D365 & Power Platform in a Solution Architect, Lead Developer, or Senior Consulting role.   A Little About Us…  We are Voco. Our name means to have a voice; to express yourself. And this is our promise to all our people – we want you to have a voice because what you think matters, and the work you do matters, and whether you are enjoying the work you do whilst you are working for us, matters.  Why? Because you’re a human being with hopes and dreams and talent and potential and if we can tap into that then we are well on our way to doing the best work of our lives and having fun along the way….and then our clients will be happy…and then they’ll come back for more…and so the circle goes. If we look after you, then you’ll look after our clients and they will look after us. It sure isn’t rocket science!  At Voco, we believe that we’re in this together – all working towards the same goals, with lots of ways to get there, and that it’s our people who differentiate us from our competitors. And therefore, if each of us has a voice that is actively encouraged and always respected, we will be constantly challenging ourselves and aiming for fresh and new. Not change for change’s sake; rather, change for better’s sake. Change for simplicity’s sake. And this is our very heartbeat – we drive positive change by simplifying the complex.  Our commitment to diversity and inclusion…even more, our commitment to belonging  We believe that all people have equal value, regardless of age, disability status, ethnicity, gender, gender identity or expression, religion or sexual orientation and we are committed to ensuring that everyone who engages with us – whether as a candidate going through our recruitment process, or as an employee or contractor – experiences true inclusion and the respect they deserve.  We believe that people work in different ways, think in different ways and are motivated by different things and, as a values-based company, what we focus on hiring people who, most importantly, share our values, which are:  Purposefully Restless – this is about being curious and improvement focused. Getting Things Done – this is about having a sense of urgency, a sense of importance and the tenacity to navigate through ambiguity and push past roadblocks. Trusted Powerhouse – this is about being trustworthy and reliable and committed to the goal. People First – this is about working well with others, collaborating, and treating others as you would want to be treated.  We want our people to feel they have found a ‘home’ with us – somewhere they belong and can be themselves.  We want anyone and everyone to feel confident to connect with us and apply to our vacancies – we will acknowledge all applications – whilst our aim is always to do so within a few days, sometimes it ends up being a bit longer as we are usually working across multiple vacancies at any one time. ",Consultants (Information & Communication Technology),

About Halter  The future of food production hinges on an important question: How do we feed the world’s growing population without compromising our natural resources? Farmers feed our population and hold the keys to vital climate solutions. At Halter, we’re on a mission to enable farmers to run the most productive and sustainable farms. Farmers are using Halter to break free from the time-intensive constraints of conventional farming. They’re growing more grass, increasing production and improving the health and wellbeing of their cattle.  We bridge deep tech into farming. Halter enables farmers to remotely shift, virtually fence and proactively monitor their cows’ health and behaviour. Can you imagine watching 500 dairy cows turn in unison and walk calmly towards the milking shed? Or beef cattle, behind virtual fences, happily grazing with their calves? No quad bikes, no dogs, no fences. Just a mob of cows walking at their own pace. People say it looks like magic. Our customers are revolutionizing farming with Halter. It's changing lives and transforming an industry.  People join Halter because they want to do meaningful work.

What we’re looking for  Someone with broad capability across Dynamics 365 and Powerapps - and solid experience designing and architecting solutions. This is a role that carries influence and we're seeking someone who has a style of leadership that brings others in and takes them on the journey.  We're fiercely proud to be NZ owned - there are no global voices telling us what we can/can't do, no global profit agendas which stifle your creativity and ability to meet the needs of the local market. No global financialeyes that see NZ as simply a regional cost centre. Most of all, you have the bandwidth to use your judgment and expertise to initiate change and influence how things are done - no inheriting direction from the global mothership.   We work with a variety of clients, most of which are large enterprises, and we develop a variety of bespoke applications for them, taking what are currently manual processes and digitising them.  And the work is sooooooo interesting! And there's nothing quite like the feeling you get when you deliver massive improvements that really make a difference. Projects tend to be 3-6mths and you may be working across multiple projects at any one time, so if you're looking for a role that offers a huge amount of variety and exposure to a wealth of different clients, then you've simply got to apply!  In a nutshell…  You will work alongside our Lead Architect and wider development team and lead the charge from a technical perspective.  We're hoping to attract someone with a proven track record of successfully delivering complex applications using D365 & Power Platform - someone who is performing in a Solution Architect, Lead Developer, or Senior Consulting role.   A Little About Us…  We are Voco. Our name means to have a voice; to express yourself. And this is our promise to all our employees and our contractors  – we want you to have a voice because what you think matters, and the work you do matters, and whether you are enjoying the work you do whilst you are working for us, matters. It matters a great deal. Why? Because you’re a human being with hopes and dreams and talent and potential and if we can tap into that then we are well on our way to doing the best work of our lives and having fun along the way….and then our clients will be happy…and then they’ll come back for more…and so the circle goes. If we look after you, then you’ll look after our clients and they will look after us. It sure isn’t rocket science!  At Voco, we believe that we’re in this together – all working towards the same goals, with lots of ways to get there, and that it’s our people who differentiate us from our competitors. And therefore, if each of us has a voice that is actively encouraged and always respected, we will be constantly challenging ourselves and aiming for fresh and new. Not change for change’s sake; rather, change for better’s sake. Change for simplicity’s sake. And this is our very heartbeat – we drive positive change by simplifying the complex.  Our commitment to diversity and inclusion…even more, our commitment to belonging  We believe that all people have equal value, regardless of age, disability status, ethnicity, gender, gender identity or expression, religion or sexual orientation and we are committed to ensuring that everyone who engages with us – whether as a candidate going through our recruitment process, or as an employee or contractor – experiences true inclusion and the respect they deserve.  We believe that people work in different ways, think in different ways and are motivated by different things and, as a values-based company, what we focus on hiring people who, most importantly, share our values, which are:  Purposefully Restless – this is about being curious and improvement focused. Getting Things Done – this is about having a sense of urgency, a sense of importance and the tenacity to navigate through ambiguity and push past roadblocks. Trusted Powerhouse – this is about being trustworthy and reliable and committed to the goal. People First – this is about working well with others, collaborating, and treating others as you would want to be treated.  We want our people to feel they have found a ‘home’ with us – somewhere they belong and can be themselves.  We want anyone and everyone to feel confident to connect with us and apply to our vacancies – we will acknowledge all applications – whilst our aim is always to do so within a few days, sometimes it ends up being a bit longer as we are usually working across multiple vacancies at any one time. ",Architects (Information & Communication Technology),

Location: Based in our office on Karangahape Road in Auckland, New Zealand; with some days of the week optionally remote. We are also supportive of fully remote members in New Zealand.  About Narrative:  Narrative is one of NZ’s fastest growing software as a service (SaaS) companies with global customers. Narrative builds products to serve the 5 million professional photographers worldwide, working to significantly reduce their processing time and to support their daily workflow with AI powered tools. We’re backed by some of the best VCs worldwide, with talent from Shopify, Google and some of NZ's best people working together to solve this.  We have thousands of photographers using our products and we’re growing. This is a unique opportunity to join our team and build industry-leading AI products.  We're committed to building products for professional photographers who work with people from all genders, ethnicities, racial and religious backgrounds. We think it’s important that our team reflects the same diverse audience. We're actively working to grow a diverse team and offer: flexible and remote working options, 1 month paid parental leave in addition to government leave, 30 hours a week for 6 months on full pay following return from parental leave (for all parents) and extended sick leave to support our team to get through the many things life can throw your way.  About the Role:  You’ll be working on Narrative’s engineering team helping to develop our product Select - a blazingly fast image selection and editing tool powered by AI and loved by professional photographers.  You’ll join the team with a strong focus on application development using Rust and React/TypeScript.  You’ll be working closely with frontend, cloud and AI engineers to deliver engaging and performant features to our users.  You will also be relentlessly product-focused. You will take a keen interest in how our users are using the product, how they wish it was better, using hard quantitative and qualitative data to inform concrete product-driven decisions. You understand that everything is a tradeoff, and there are simply not enough hours in the day to do everything. To that end, you are constantly focusing on the most important issues for the product.  In order to succeed in this role, you will need to be curious. We want people who will bring a fresh perspective, question how things are done and experiment with new approaches and technologies. You will hold a very senior role within our engineering team, helping to form a vision for the architecture of our app, preaching best practices, advocating for better testing techniques, and helping to mentor and level up the junior developers.  This is a rare opportunity to have influence and impact on a world-class product in an early stage and help make it a success.  About our technology:  Select is an Electron app built using Web technologies such as React and Typescript. Select’s brain is a speedy wee daemon called Maxwell written in Rust. Maxwell does all the heavy lifting for Select, including image processing and ML inferencing.  You might work on:  Creating new APIs to expose functionality to the Electron frontend.  Building out image scanning and ML processing pipelines, both on the desktop and in the cloud.  Interfacing from Rust into existing C and C++ libraries and integrating them into our build and CI pipeline.  Adding new ML models to our processing pipeline using cross-platform ML inference environments such as ONNX.  Working with the product, frontend, cloud and machine learning teams to construct feasibility assessments and estimates for new projects. This includes opportunities to propose your own projects directly to the company leadership.  Our ideal candidate:  The ideal candidate for this role brings a wealth of experience and wisdom to the team, but with a strong sense of humility and empathy. Experience with specific technologies is less important than the knowledge of how to live in a small but fast moving startup environment, a good intuition for clean and sustainable software design/architecture, and a strong desire to help everyone on the team do their best work.  We expect the applicant for this position to be able to architect solutions in an incremental and pragmatic fashion while ensuring consistency and coherency of the whole where practically possible. Sharing knowledge should be a baseline deliverable as part of any new feature or behavior you are authoring.  Despite expecting an experienced developer for this role, we don’t require applicants to have any experience writing production Rust code. Having a proven interest in Rust over time and enough familiarity with Rust to allow you to use it to solve basic problems is sufficient for a start. We believe that the technical experience we’re looking for in this role mostly transcends the boundaries of specific programming languages.  This role has a strong research component. Candidates should be able to investigate new technical solutions, especially in the photography domain.  Ideal candidates will have commercial experience developing desktop or mobile applications.  Nice to have:  An interest in photography, and/or a deep understanding of the professional photography software industry.  Experience with image container formats and codecs such as TIFF, JPEG, HEIF, PNG, etc.  Experience with image metadata standards such as EXIF and XMP.  Experience writing C, C++, Python or Elixir code.  Familiarity with hardware-acceleration APIs such as OpenCL, Metal, Vulkan, WebGPU, CUDA, etc., or familiarity with SIMD.  Experience in async green-thread environments such as Goroutines, JS Promises, C++ Coroutines or Rust Futures (async/await).  Familiarity with native software development and distribution on OSX or Windows.  Familiarity with distributing native code to Web applications, such as WebAssembly or Node.js C++ Add-ons.  An understanding of machine learning, computer vision or image processing, e.g. PyTorch, numpy, pillow, OpenCV, etc.  Experience with cloud computing, Docker etc.     At Narrative, we are committed to developing AI software that serves people of all ethnicities, genders, and religious backgrounds. We want our team to reflect this commitment. Research indicates that some men apply to jobs when they meet around 60% of the criteria, while women and other underrepresented individuals often only apply if they meet all the criteria. So, if you really love the idea of working at Narrative and have a strong desire to learn and improve, please apply, even if you don't tick every box in the job description.",Developers/Programmers (Information & Communication Technology),
